# genomics-blog

The scripts in this repository reproduce the benchmarks in the "Using
Arm servers to reduce the time and cost of Genomics" blog on community.arm.com
[link TBD]

Before running, the data should be downloaded:

```
./download-data.sh
```

In each of _bwa_, _bwa-mem2_, _minimap2_ subdirectories a shell script will build and execute the application.
